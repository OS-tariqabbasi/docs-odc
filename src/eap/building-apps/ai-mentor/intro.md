# About Mentor App Generator and Editor

OutSystems Mentor App Generator and Editor are designed to help you create full-stack, scalable apps and evolve them using GenAI. Mentor App Generator transforms your ideas into an app in minutes using natural language prompts. You can also upload a requirement document. AI extracts the entities, roles, attributes, and static records to generate an app.

Mentor App Editor allows you to enhance your apps using short, focused keyword prompts to get AI-powered suggestions. When more granularity is required, you can refine and customize your apps further using ODC Studio.

OutSystems Mentor App Generator and App Editor build apps faster while maintaining high-quality standards. Some of the benefits are:

![Icons representing the benefits of Mentor App: designs and validates, converts requirements effortlessly, reduces costs efficiently.](images/benefits-mentor-app-ams.png "Benefits of Mentor App")

* Creates initial designs and validates app prototypes in no time.

* Converts product requirements into functional code, data models, business logic, and UI with zero effort.

* Streamlining early-stage apps saves costs and resources. It allows teams to focus on complex, high-value tasks without wasting time or effort on repetitive coding.

## Patterns

Learn about some of the different patterns recognized by AI for AI Mentor App Generator and Editor.

### Patterns in Mentor App Generator

* You can integrate it with Data Fabric, and public entities.

* You can edit entities before generating an app by adding, changing, or removing the suggested entity.

* The generated app includes a predefined set of roles you can modify before generating it.

* AI detects static entities and related records, automatically displaying them as tags in the UI for status or task management use cases. Â 

* AI decides which sections to include in your app dashboard. It gives each section an appropriate section title and chooses to use a table, gallery, or chart.

* You can download existing data or upload new data to replace sample data generated by the app.

* The generated apps have minor changes regarding the standard OutSystems UI theme, such as thinner labels, titles, icons, softer corners on buttons, and a hero section that shows the theme color. Relating to theme colors, if you specify the theme's primary color by name or hex value in your requirements document, the generated app uses this color. You can also use the input to set the color, even if it's not mentioned in your document. Otherwise, Mentor App Generator picks a color from a curated set.

### Patterns in Mentor App Editor

The following high-level changes suggested in the App Editor can impact several places in your app. Colored indicators display where these changes apply.

* You can add or delete entities and their attributes. AI generates all the attributes, including static entities or static entity records, screens, menu items, and the relationships to and from them.

* Adjust security by adding and deleting roles.

**Note:** Consider current limitations. The suggestions only support **add** operations. Operations such as **change** and **rename** aren't supported yet.

## Mentor App Generator best practices

To generate an app in the Mentor App Generator, you can use the following:

* Natural language prompts

* Requirement documents

### Natural language prompts

When using natural language prompts, follow these best practices to maximize the accuracy of the generated app.

#### Best practices

![Icons illustrating best practices for natural language prompts: ensure clarity concisely, organize data model, add role-specific details.](images/natural-language-prompts-best-practices-ams.png "Best Practices for Natural Language Prompts")

* **Be clear and concise.** Include the app name, purpose, and main functionality in 1-2 sentences.

    * Example: Create an Employee Onboarding app that tracks employee details, onboarding steps, and status updates. It should have a list and edit screens and roles for HR and Managers.

* **Structure the data model.** Mention entities and attributes if you know them.

    * Example: The app should have entities for Employees (Name, ID, Department, Role) and Onboarding steps (Step name, Status, Due date).

* **Add role-specific details.** Mention the roles and permissions required if you know them.

    * Example: Managers can update onboarding steps. HR can add and edit employee records.

Here's an example of a prompt following the best practices:

Create an Inventory Management app to track Products (Name, ID, Stock) and Orders (Order ID, Product, Quantity, Status). Managers can view stock. Admins can update inventory.

### Requirement document

Requirement documents are ideal if you have an app with detailed specifications. OutSystems encourages you to use your existing requirement documents. However, consider the best practices regarding format and structure for maximum effectiveness.

#### Best practices

![Icons illustrating best practices for requirement documents: use supported formats, organize requirements logically, avoid excessive details, ensure relevant content, avoid media usage.](images/requirement-best-practices-ams.png "Best Practices for Requirement Documents")

* **Use supported formats**. Supported formats include .txt, .docx, and .pdf. Ensure the file size is under 5MB.

* **Organize requirements logically.** Include separate sections for:

    * App purpose and overview

    * Entities and attributes

    * Roles and permissions

* **Avoid excessive details.** Use the document for functional requirements, not implementation details.

* **Avoid content that is irrelevant to the app.**

* **Avoid using screenshots or other media during this stage.** These aren't processed and may hamper the generation process.

* **Avoid using tables.** The text inside the tables is ignored.

Refer to [Order Management System Requirements Document](resources/Order-Management-System-Requirements-Document.doc) for a sample requirement document.

## Mentor App Editor best practices

Follow these best practices for effective keyword prompting for suggestions:

![Icons illustrating best practices for keyword prompts: specify required changes, use role-based prompts, refine data models, avoid ambiguity.](images/prompt-best-practices-ams.png "Best Practices for Keyword Prompts")

* **Be specific about changes.** Use short prompts to add data.

* **Use role-based prompts.** Include roles explicitly to enhance security.

    * Example: Add a new role: Manager.

* **Focus on data model refinements.**

    * Example: Add salary to Employee.

* **Avoid ambiguity.** Avoid using vague prompts such as "Make the app better."
