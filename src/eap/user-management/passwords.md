# Passwords

New users must set up their own passwords. The password must be at least 12 characters long and contain at least:

* One numeric digit
* One character from this set: !, \, #, $, %, &, ', (, ), *, +, ,, -, ., /, :, ;, <, =, >, ?, @, [
* One upper-case letter

Only users can manage their passwords. Users can change their password using the **ODC Portal** > **User dropdown** > **Change password**.

Organization members with an organization role such as Developer or Admin can also recover their forgotten password from the Portal login page by clicking **Forgot password**.

If you're not receiving the password reset email, please check your spam folder and any filters. The emails are sent from `noreply@outsystems.dev`.

Admins don't have permission to change or recover other users' passwords.

You can use pre-built user screens in your app to enable end-users to change and recover their password. For more information, see [Custom authentication flows](../building-apps/ui/custom-auth.md). If organization users (Organization members) working in an app need to recover their password, they must use the OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) Portal.

ODC temporarily locks users out after five consecutive failed sign-in or password change attempts. The lockout duration increases with each additional failed attempt, starting at just a few seconds and reaching a maximum of approximately 15 minutes. After the lockout period passes, your user information returns to the initial state.

## Password reset

ODC provides pre-built screens that allow end users to request a new password (RecoverPasswordRequest) and set a new password (RecoverPasswordReset) for their app. For detailed information, refer to [Custom authentication flows](../building-apps/ui/custom-auth.md).

The password reset in ODC is authenticated via a verification code received in an email. 

Here’s the high-level overview of the password reset mechanism in ODC:

1. To receive the verification code, the end-user enters the email address in **RecoverPasswordRequest** screen.

1. The **RecoverPasswordRequest** screen invokes the system server action **StartResetPassword,** which sends the verification code to the end user's email address.

1. The user receives the verification code and a link to the **RecoverPasswordReset** page in the email. 

1. The user opens the  **RecoverPasswordReset** page and enters the new secure password. 

1. The **RecoverPasswordReset** page invokes the system client action **FinishResetPassword**, and sets the email, verification code, and new password for the end user in the Identity server.
